This code is done in a simple approach of loop, but the implementation is complex for me

this could be done in different approach I think with mathematics, differentiation(to get minimum value of the equation)
for mathematical approach the code would be simpler but the calculation would be so complex so I avoided that approach 

This code is the hardest for me among all 6 of them

This code is not as optimized as the mathematical approach which would be o(n) probably but this code is done in o(n^2)

according to the constrains  given in the question here, this code is taking 0.3 sec. for worst case and taking 125 KB memory
