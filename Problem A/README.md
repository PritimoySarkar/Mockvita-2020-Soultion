Thanks to Supriyo Das[https://github.com/supriyo15998] for this wonderful approach

The idea behind this solution was proposed by my friend Supriyo.

I also added a debug file to check if for the given input the code is generating the right output or not.
I tried to put the denominations in a list and check if we can create any muber in range(1-n) inclusive and turn out the code is perfectly giving the solution.
